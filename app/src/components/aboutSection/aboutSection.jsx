                    <b>Hi, I’m Isaac :)</b>  Let me tell you a bit about myself.

                    <b>I'm Interested in...</b>

                    🚀 Exploring full-stack and product management roles, with a passion for both technology and business. My focus is on creating beloved products that cater to the bigger picture.

                    📚 Currently a second-year university student, eager to explore various opportunities and areas.

                    <b>My other passions... </b>

                    💪 I'm a gym enthusiast, using it to enhance my focus and discipline while relieving stress.

                    🤽‍♂️ I used to play competitive water polo, achieving accolades like "Most Improved Player" and "Most Valuable Defender," along with winning a Western Conference final. I also have experience in competitive volleyball at provincial and national levels, and I still enjoy recreational play.

                    📈 Recently, I've developed a keen interest in learning about entrepreneurship and business through YouTube's entrepreneurial success stories and founder interviews.

                    🍿 I'm a big movie buff, always up for watching the latest releases, especially in theaters.
